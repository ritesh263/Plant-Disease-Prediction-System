# Plant-Disease-Prediction-System
Agricultural productivity is heavily influenced by plant health, and the presence of diseases can
significantly reduce crop yields, disrupt food supply chains, and negatively impact the economy.
Traditionally, plant disease diagnosis has relied on manual inspection by agricultural experts, which is
time-consuming, labour-intensive, and prone to human errorâ€”particularly in remote or resourcelimited settings. To address this challenge, this project proposes a Plant Disease Prediction System
that utilizes advanced technologies in machine learning, computer vision, and image processing to
enable the early detection and accurate classification of plant diseases.
The system is designed to analyse images of plant leaves and predict the presence of disease based on
visible symptoms such as discoloration, texture changes, and lesion patterns. A large dataset of labelled
leaf images, representing both healthy and diseased plants across multiple species, is used to train a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This deep learning model is capable of automatically
extracting and learning relevant features from the images, eliminating the need for manual feature
engineering. Data augmentation techniques are employed to improve model generalization and
performance, especially under varying lighting and background conditions.
